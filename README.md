# add new product to db
In this project we created two endpoints /home and /addproduct. Addproduct has a form that allows you to add a product and price to the mysql database. After submitting the user is redirected to the product view page /home which allows the user to view all the products and prices in the database.
A single POJO was created for the entity consisting of the price and name columns. The JSP was built out in the Store Controller file.
